setup

  doublesync src122130 and devenv.sh
    (since we're going to use WLST to create the domain)

  mkdir -m 777 -p /scratch/k8s-dir
    (i.e. the parent directory for persistent volumes)

  make sure to get rid your old setup:
  (I had problems getting stuff to run until I got rid of this stuff)
    operator and domain namespaces
    persistent volumes
    cluster roles & cluster role bindings
    maybe /scratch/k8s_dir

poc source files

  demo1/
    uses offline wlst to create a domain with a configured cluster
    uses a domain persistent volume

    domain-ns-env.sh
      - sets up a bunch of environment variables needed for the domain namespace level

    domain-env.sh
      - sets up a bunch of environment variables that are needed for the domain level,
        imports domain-ns-env.sh too

    create-domains-ns.sh
      - create the domains namespace and namespace wide kubernetes resources

    delete-domains-ns.sh
      - removes the domains namespace and its namespace wide kubernetes resources
      - NOTE: don't call this unless you've called delete-domain.sh first!

    create-domain.sh
      - create the domain and corresponding domain wide kubernetes resources and persistent volumes
      - NOTE: don't call this unless you've called create-domains-ns.sh first!

    delete-domain.sh
      - create the domain and corresponding domain wide kubernetes resources and persistent volumes
      - NOTE: don't call this unless you've called create-domains-ns.sh first!
 
    simulate-operator-runtime.sh
      - creates a pod that introspects the domain image and creates and loads a config map
        that contains the domain's topology as well as a situation config file for the domain
        that gets mounted into the server pods
      - also creates yaml files for all of the server pods and services
      - NOTE: don't call this unless you've called create-domain.sh first

  kit/
    represents the files in an operator kit

    templates/
      template yaml files that the customer must copy and customize

      utilities level:
        none (yet)

      domain namespace level:
        domain-cm.yamlt - template config map containing the operator's server pod lifecycle scripts

      domain level:
        admin-server-pod.yamlt - admin server's pod template
        admin-server-service.yamlt - admin server's service template
        admin-server-t3-service.yamlt - admin server's t3 service template
        managed-server-pod.yamlt - managed server pod template
        managed-server-service.yamlt - managed server service template

        introspect-domain-pod.yamlt - pod template for introspecting the domain image
          validates that the domain can be used by the operator
          generates server and cluster topology info that the operator runtime needs
          create a situational configuration file binding the domain to the operator

    samples/
      sample template files that a customer may copy and customize

      utilities level:

        customize-property.sh
        customize.sh
          - scripts that expand/customize a template file
            the caller needs to have set up a bunch of environment variables
            containing the desired values (e.g. demo1/demoenv.sh)
          - the demos copy various templates from the kit/samples and kit/templates
            directories into the demos' 'generated' directories then use customize.sh
            to customize the copies to the demo

      domain namespace level:
        none (yet)

      domain level:
        create-domain-home-with-configured-cluster.sh
        create-domain-home-with-dynamic-cluster.sh
          - use offline wlst to create a local domain home
            it can be booted locally (i.e. no pod needed)

        patch-domain-home.sh
          - converts the domain home, java home and mw home pathnames that are baked into
            the files generated create-domain-home-...sh to the pathnames that are used
            when the domain home is used by a pod

        domain-logs-pv.yamlt
        domain-logs-pvc.yamlt
        domain-home-pv.yamlt
        domain-home-pvc.yamlt
          - template yaml files for creating the kubernetes persistent volumes and claims
            for the domain logs persistent volume and domain home persistent volume
          - samples that use in-image domains don't use domain-home-pv/c.yamlt

poc generated files

    demo1/generated/

      - generated yaml files and scripts for this demo

      domains namespace level:

        domain-cm.yaml - config map of server pod lifecycle scripts for this domain namespace

      domain level:

        start-server.sh             - manually starts a server by creating its kubernetes resources
        stop-server.sh              - manually stops a server by deleting its kubernetes resources
        server-pod-desc.sh          - describes a server's pod
        server-pod-state.sh         - gets a server's pod's state
        server-pod-log.sh           - prints a server's pod's log
        server-out.sh               - prints a server stdout file
        server-log.sh               - prints a server's log
        server-nm-log.sh            - prints a server's node manager log
        server-nm-state.sh          - gets the state that the node manager thinks a server is in
        wait-for-server-to-start.sh - waits for the server to start
          all per-server scripts the name of a server (as, ms1, ms2 or ms3)
            e.g. generated/start-server.sh as

        domain-home
          - contains the generated domain, before its pathnames have been patched
          - this means you can 'cd' there and run startWeblogicServer.sh
          - it also means that it cannot be directly used by a pod since the
            pathnames in the generated files are based on the shell that ran
            create-domain-home.sh, instead of the ones that are needed in a pod

        domain-bindings-cm.yaml - config map with a situational config for this domain

        domain-logs-pv.yaml
        domain-logs-pvc.yaml
        domain-home-pv.yaml
        domain-home-pvc.yaml
          persistent volumes and claims for the domain logs and domain home persistent volumes

        admin-server-service.yamlt
        admin-server-t3-service.yamlt
        managed-server-pod.yamlt
        managed-server-service.yamlt
          templates for creating pods and services for the servers in this domain
          (normally we'd put them in the domain crd so that the operator runtime could
          use them as it needs to create and delete per-server pods)

        as-pod.yaml

        ms2-pod.yaml
        ms2-service.yaml
        ms3-pod.yaml
        ms3-service.yaml
          actual pods and services for all the servers in this domain
          (since we don't have an operator ...)
          TBD - could create them created and deleted by start-server.sh and
          stop-server.sh instead, just as the operator runtime would

    /scratch/k8s-dir/demo1-domain-uid
      contains the persistent volumes for demo1's domain

      domain-logs/
         - contains the domain, node manager and server logs

      domain-home/
        - contains the domain home that the pods use
        - the pathnames in the files have been patched so that the pods can use them
          (e.g. domain home, java home and mw home have been changed to the values
          that should be used inside the pod)
